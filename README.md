# TexFlow


**Write, compile, and preview LaTeX documents seamlessly within your Google Docs environment, using Google Drive for storage â€“ all processed locally in your browser.**

TexFlow is an open-source browser extension that transforms your familiar Google Docs interface into a powerful and convenient LaTeX editor. It integrates directly with your Google Drive for easy file management. It utilizes local browser resources for compilation, offering a private, streamlined LaTeX workflow without needing to install bulky desktop applications.

## How It Works

TexFlow intelligently enhances your Google Docs environment to support a full LaTeX workflow:

1.  **Editing**: You write and edit your LaTeX source code in the main Google Docs editor pane.
2.  **File Management**: Project files (LaTeX source, images, class files, etc.) are stored and accessed from your Google Drive. TexFlow works with these files directly. You can access the folder in the second tab.
3.  **Local Compilation**: When you trigger a compile (e.g., via a button or auto-compile feature), TexFlow runs entirely within your browser to process the LaTeX code and generate a PDF.
4.  **Integrated Preview**: The resulting PDF is rendered and displayed on the main extension page.

## Getting Started (Not published yet)

1.  **Authorize Google Drive**:
    *   Upon first use, TexFlow will ask for permission to connect to your Google Drive. This is necessary to read your LaTeX project files. A folder for the given document is automatically created for you.
2.  **Open/Create a LaTeX Document**:
    *   You might create a new Google Doc and activate TexFlow by clicking on the extension or opening the side panel manually.
3.  **Start Writing!**:
    *   The TexFlow interface will load within Google Docs.

## Why TexFlow?

*   **Convenience**: Combines the power of LaTeX with the Google Workspace environment for FREE.
*   **Privacy**: Local compilation means your documents aren't processed on third-party servers beyond Google Drive storage, which you control.
*   **No Heavy Installation**: Avoids the need to install and maintain large local TeX distributions.
*   **Collaboration**: Leveraging Google Docs allows unlimited collaborative LaTeX editing, similar to standard Docs collaboration.
